abstract: |
    Optimal low-thrust trajectory optimization is computationally expensive due to long transfer durations and complex dynamics, motivating the use of suboptimal trajectories for warm-starting optimization. While recent machine learning approaches enable efficient trajectory generation, they often rely on simplified
    dynamics, lack robustness to problem formulation, and operate as non-auditable black boxes—limitations that are undesirable for mission-critical guidance. This work proposes a fuzzy logic–based approach inspired by neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Fuzzy ODEs combine computational efficiency with interpretability and robustness, making them well suited for trajectory generation. A Fuzzy ODE architecture is developed and evaluated on a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit to Geosynchronous Orbit problem with fuel minimization as the objective. Results demonstrate the method’s ability to leverage higher-fidelity dynamics to effectively target the semi-major axis, while highlighting opportunities to extend the approach for improved control of additional state variables in future work.
