abstract: |
    Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging. This study evaluates and compares the performance of three deep learning architectures: ResNet50 (a conventional convolutional neural network), ResNet50 enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and the Tiny Swin Transformer (a Vision Transformer model) for three-class classification (CNV, Drusen, Normal). Cross-validation results on the OCT dataset show that ResNet50 achieves the highest overall performance, with a Macro AUC of 0.985 ± 0.005 and Accuracy of 0.934 ± 0.015. Notably, Res-Net50+CBAM optimizes clinical performance by achieving the highest CNV recall (0.940 ± 0.036), underscoring the importance of attention mechanisms in improving sensitivity and reducing the risk of missing critical pathological cases. The study concludes that while ResNet50 remains the most effective overall, ResNet50+CBAM offers superior stability, interpretability, and clinically relevant sensitivity, making it a promising model for retinal disease screening and diagnostic support.
