abstract: |
    Visualization Assessment of Tendency (VAT) in Clustering has been a technique for the identification of data clusters since 2002. Although a proven
    technique, it has suffered from the curse of dimensionality, leading to limited performance for datasets with more than 5000 elements. The core of the model is based on Prim’s algorithm, a greedy Minimum Spanning Tree search that uses Bubble Sort at its core. By replacing Bubble Sort with Merge Sort using a priority queue, the updated ”mergeVAT” algorithm complexity changes from O(N) = N^3 to O(N) = N^2*logN. For datasets with 1,000 elements, this leads to a speed up of 30×. In addition, by identifying the permutation loops and bit-masking, it is now possible to compute the full VAT of a 58000 element dataset in place while requiring only O(N) = N^2/16 additional working memory in less than 2 minutes.
