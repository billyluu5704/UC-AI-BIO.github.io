    A fundamental paradox plagues the deployment of Machine Learning in cybersecurity: supervised models generalize poorly to novel, Out-of-Distribution (OoD) attacks, whereas unsupervised models often suffer from poor separability, leading to unmanageable false-alarm rates. This challenge is exemplified by the BETH dataset, a kernel-level benchmark in which the training data consists solely of benign and ``suspicious'' insider behaviors, whereas the test set consists almost entirely of novel botnet activation attacks. To bridge this detection gap, we propose a Hybrid Fuzzy Ensemble that synergizes the precision of supervised learning with the adaptability of unsupervised clustering. Our architecture integrates a gradient-optimized Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifier to act as an expert on known insider threats, with a parallel Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) module to detect geometric anomalies. A critical finding of our research is that traditional fuzzy membership scores degrade in high-dimensional feature spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. We overcome this by introducing a robust Min Distance metric that exploits the raw geometric isolation of botnet activation attacks. This approach yields a state-of-the-art AUROC of 0.9951 on the BETH test set, outperforming the original Isolation Forest baseline by 17.1%. By combining near-perfect OoD detection with the intrinsic interpretability of fuzzy logic, our framework offers a viable path toward robust, transparent, and autonomous network defense.
