abstract: |
    Differential privacy has emerged as a common way for protecting sensitive information in machine learning systems. Adding noise to a database before processing serves as the primary mechanism for achieving privacy guarantees. This creates a fundamental privacy-utility tradeoff that varies across model architectures, motivating the search for techniques that improve robustness under noise. Fuzzy inference systems, with their inherent tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty, asks: do soft decision boundaries provide resilience to privacy-preserving noise? We investigate fuzzy feature augmentation which adds fuzzy c-means cluster membership values to conventional model inputs as a practical strategy for enhancing noise resilience. Using a medical cost prediction dataset, we compare four models (Ridge Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest) with and without fuzzy augmentation across multiple noise levels ranging from 0% to 5% perturbation. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements for non-linear models: Gradient Boosting improves by 2.88%, MLP by 2.36%, and Random Forest by 1.92%, while Ridge Regression shows no benefit. Analysis reveals that fuzzy membership features encode local geometric structures that tree-based and neural models can exploit for improved predictions, even when original features are corrupted by noise. These findings establish fuzzy feature augmentation as a low-overhead technique for improving privacy-utility tradeoffs in machine learning applications involving sensitive data.
