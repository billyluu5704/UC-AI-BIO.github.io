abstract: |
    Modern fly-by-wire aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles increasingly rely on advanced control strategies to ensure performance, robustness, and safety under nominal and degraded operating conditions. Fuzzy logic controllers have demonstrated strong robustness and fast convergence compared to conventional linear and PID-based approaches; however, their performance is highly dependent on manual tuning of membership functions and rule bases. This paper presents a Genetic Fuzzy System (GFS) approach for optimizing a fuzzy PID pitch attitude hold controller for an F-4 fighter aircraft model. A genetic algorithm is employed to automatically tune the membership functions and rule parameters of a Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system, with the objective of minimizing settling time while preserving stability and robustness. The proposed GFS-PID controller is trained on a nominal approach condition and evaluated on both nominal and 50% degraded aircraft dynamics to assess generalization and robustness under uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate that the GA-optimized fuzzy PID controller achieves significant reductions in settling time and rise time compared to a manually tuned fuzzy PID controller, without increasing
    overshoot or degrading steady-state performance. In the degraded approach case, the proposed method yields a settling time reduction of up to 25.5%, highlighting its effectiveness in noisy and uncertain environments. These results indicate that genetic optimization provides a systematic and reliable framework for enhancing fuzzy flight control systems and supports the use of Genetic Fuzzy Systems for robust autonomous aircraft control applications.
